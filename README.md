My First Respository....don'tjudgeme!

Koalify here, I heard about github and was told by others that this would be very resourceful to use for web development. In a way, it's suppose to allow me to actually post my websites or my portfolio here and share it to anyone that be interest in my web development skill. Of course, I'm rather on a intermediate level with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, I believe I can learn to expand my skills further in web development and hopefully get a job. Whether its on freelance or a company, I'm okay with either options. Until then, I want to continue to learn more as I go and show everyone what I can make.
